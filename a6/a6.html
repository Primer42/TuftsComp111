<h1> Comp111 Assignment 6<br> 
Benchmarking <br> 
</h1> 

<h1>Overview</h1>

An operating system <em>benchmark</em> is a program that determines
the speed of some process within the operating system.  There are
several kinds of benchmarks, depending upon what one is measuring.  In
this assignment we will measure both the speed of disk I/O
and the speed of cache hits.  

<h1>Objective</h1> 

Your objective is to write a benchmark program for disk I/O that measures the
following attributes (if possible): 
<ul> 
<li> The speed with which one can read from the disk containing your home 
     directory (it's the same for everyone). 
<li> The speed with which one can read from disk cache. 
<li> The speed with which one can write to the disk containing your home
     directory. 
<li> The speed with which one can write to disk cache. 
</ul> 
Note that as usual, I have been a bit slimey and one of these is exceedingly
difficult to measure. Figuring out which one is up to you! 
If you manage to measure it, you deserve extra credit!
<p>
A solution to this assignment is a program <code>a6.c</code> that
constructs experiments and then measures them.  For each kind of
measurement, it should create a situation to measure, do the
measurement, and then return the results.  It should only create files
in the current directory of the invoked process.
<p>
It is rather important to do your experimenting on
Comp111.cs.tufts.edu, because you are going to be taking up a
substantive amount of CPU time to do this. Keeping CPU time from 
influencing your measurements is a significant part of the problem. 
<p> 
There is one file to help you: /comp/111/a/a6/testfile.dat: 
<pre> 
-rw-r--r-- 1 couch faculty 1000000000 Dec  5  2010 testfile.dat
</pre> 
This is a really big file that you can use to test reads. 

<h1>Hints</h1> 

Several hints:
<ul> 
<li> When you read a block from disk the first time, you read it from 
     the disk itself. The second time, it is read from cache, so measuring
     the speed of the cache just requires repeating the operation and 
     ignoring the first read. 
<li> The speed of disk I/O can only be measured if the file to be written 
     or read is not already in cache.  Otherwise we are measuring the speed of 
     the cache, and not the speed of the disk! Thus it becomes important to 
     run your program on a file that is not in cache, which means in turn
     that you must construct that file, wait for it to flush out of cache, 
     and <em>then</em> measure how fast you can read it. 
<li> I strongly suggest that you use raw I/O, i.e., <code>read</code> and 
     <code>write</code> (instead of formatted I/O including <code>fprintf</code>     and <code>fscanf</code>) to read from and write to disk. Otherwise, you 
     will see a buffering delay that is not what you should be measuring. 
</ul>
