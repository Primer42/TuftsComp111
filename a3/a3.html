<h3> Comp111 Assignment 3: sandboxing a process</h3> 

<h3> Overview</h3>

<p> A very common problem in process management is to manage the
behavior of a process whose source code and behavior you cannot
control, e.g., a student-submitted program for a programming class.  A
systematic problem in grading student programs is that their program
can do anything at all that the user who is running the program can
do.  

<p> One solution to this problem is to create a "sandbox" for the
process to be graded, that keeps the process from doing things it
should not be able to do.  Sandboxing is so important that whole
operating systems (most recently, Google Chrome OS -- a version of
linux not to be confused with the Chrome browser) have been written to
provide the service.

<p>In this assignment, you will write a program that executes another
program (e.g., a program to be graded) in a controlled environment.
When executing in this environment, the program should only do things
that are explicitly allowed according to a predetermined policy, and
should be killed (and a note made in a log) if the program does
anything not allowed by the policy.  

<p> Just to make this interesting, I am going to give you some behaviors to stop. I will provide several misbehaving programs and you have to keep them 
from misbehaving. Each program will try to take over the resources of
the whole machine and keep everyone from working. To be fair about this, 
I am going to craft them so that a simple control-C will stop them; in 
the worst case I can craft them so that this won't work!

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p> Your objective is to write a <code>C</code> program
<code>watch</code> that, when invoked, runs another given program and
attempts to control behaviors of the child process. 
The program to run should be specified in watch's first argument. 
E.g., 
<pre>watch a.out</pre> 
should invoke your program <code>watch</code> to invoke and watch the execution of the child process <code>a.out</code>. 
<code>watch</code> should 
react to several conditions in the child
process with preventative actions, reporting each one to <code>stderr</code>. 
<ol> 
<li>  If the child occupies more than 4 MB of stack memory, it should be 
killed and this event should be reported.  The program 
<a href="a3/1.c">1.c</a> does this. 
<li>  If the child occupies more than 4 MB of heap memory, it should be 
killed and this event should be reported.  The program 
<a href="a3/2.c">2.c</a> does this.
<li> If the child forks more than 20 times, it should be killed and the 
event should be reported.  
The program <a href="a3/3.c">3.c</a> does this.

<li>  If the child uses more than 1 CPU-second of computer time, it should
be killed and this event should be reported.  
The program <a href="a3/4.c">4.c</a> does this.
<li> If the child produces more than 100 lines of output to stdout, 
     it should be killed and this should be reported. 
The program <a href="a3/4.c">5.c</a> does this.

</ol> 
When the child dies, its total runtime, number of lines printed to stdout, and time of death should be reported.  
After any of these, the <code>watch</code> program should exit. 
A regular exit from watch should also report time spent by the child. 
<p> 
Part of the problem is to distinguish which behaviors can be controlled
through the operating system itself, which ones can be controlled through
monitoring, and which can only be controlled partially due to extenuating
circumstances. Some of the above conditions are easy
to assure, and <em>some are impossible to completely control.</em>
It is part of your task to determine which ones are possible to accomplish. 

<h3>Notes</h3> 
<ol> 
<li> You must forward everything the child prints to stdout, even if 
     you capture it yourself. 
<li> You cannot use privilege in any way.  All
     processes must run as your user, not root.  
<li> It is not permissible to rewrite the operating system!
     I only say this because people have tried this in the past! 
<li> It is possible to invoke the <code>gdb</code> interface and single-step 
     the child program, but this is very difficult and not recommended. 
     See <code>man waitid</code> and <code>man ptrace</code> for details. 
<li> It is <em>always</em> a better solution to employ the operating
     system to monitor the process if possible.  Read up on "resource 
     limits" as a hint to addressing some of the requirements. 
<li> Some child conditions can be detected via signals.  Use them if 
     at all possible! In particular, you will want to trap SIGCHLD 
     in the parent and react accordingly! 
<li> Part of your program can be some form of "monitoring loop" 
     in which the program repeatedly measures the behavior of the child. 
<li> Feel free to redirect I/O from the child to a subthread of your watch
     process. 
<li> You should presume that the child can do anything, including changing
     its behavior according to all available system calls. You cannot assume
     that the child won't try to get around your controls via malicious means. 
<li> In particular, note that <em>you cannot install a signal handler in the 
     child</em>, because during an <code>exec</code>, that handler would get overwritten!
<li> But the child is permitted to install its own signal handlers to thwart 
     your controls, and you must be able to handle that! 
</ol>

<h3> Where to work </h3> 

For this assignment, since we are going to be doing something
"dangerous", we will work on our own machines,
<code>comp111-01.cs.tufts.edu</code> and <code>comp111-02.cs.tufts.edu</code>.  These machines are <em>inside the
firewall</em> and cannot be accessed directly.
To work there, <em> ssh to <code>linux.cs.tufts.edu</code> first</em>, then to 
<code>comp111-01.cs.tufts.edu</code> (or <code>-02</code>).  It is rather important that
you do <em>not</em> test this program on <code>sun.eecs.tufts.edu</code>
or <code>linux.eecs.tufts.edu</code>, especially since you will be 
running intentionally antisocial programs!

<p>If you manage to crash one of the servers, please don't try to run your
program on the other one until you're sure that you've fixed it. I say
this because in the past, students have managed to crash <em>both</em> servers
from a single cause. 


<h3> Submitting completed assignments</h3>
<p> The whole program should be in a single c program <code>watch.c</code>.
Programs in other languages are unacceptable.
The beginning of the file should describe how to compile the
file, in comments. A typical compilation command might be:
<pre>
gcc -g -o watch watch.c
</pre>
To submit this program, first ssh to <code>comp111-01</code> or <code>-02</code>, 
then type:
<pre>
provide comp111 a3 watch.c 
</pre>
where <code>watch.c</code> 
is a file containing your program.
<p> Your submission will be graded offline. To see grading status 
or comments, type: 
<pre>
progress comp111
</pre>

<h3>Checklist</h3> 
Before you provide your solution for grading, please ensure the following requirements: 
<table border='1'> 
<tr><td><input type='checkbox' name='test'></td><td><code>watch.c</code> is a self-contained C program</td></tr> 
<tr><td><input type='checkbox' name='test'></td><td>The method for compiling watch.c is documented in a comment at the top of the program. </td></tr> 
<tr><td><input type='checkbox' name='test'></td><td>Your program, when compiled into the file "watch", takes one argument that is the name of a compiled child program. Typing <code>watch a.out</code> will watch whatever process results from executing <code>a.out</code>. <em>It is not acceptable to make us change your program to test each case.</em> </td></td>
<tr><td><input type='checkbox' name='test'></td><td>At the top of your <code>watch.c</code> program, in a block comment, you have specified how you handled each condition, and whether there are cases that your solution does not catch. </td></tr> 
</table>
