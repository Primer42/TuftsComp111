<h3> Comp111 Assignment 1: gaming the operating system</h3> 

<h3> Overview</h3>

<p> In class we have discussed the nature of time in an operating system,
including the fundamental inaccuracies in the system clock. In this 
assignment, it is your job to <em>take advantage</em> of these inaccuracies
to create a computation that runs "under the radar" of the operating system
accounting mechanism. 

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p> Your objective is to modify the <code>C</code> program
<code>life.c</code> so that it seems to consume less CPU time than it
actually does!  This program will be tested on
<code>linux.cs.tufts.edu</code>, which is a linux machine, and
should be compiled with <code>gcc</code>.  The program reads an input
file and runs Conway's game of life on the input, for a specified
number of iterations.  Thus, it is a <em>compute-bound</em> program.
Several potential input files are included, named pat1-pat6 in the
assignment directory. 
<p>The code for the target program is available 
<a href="a1/life.c">here</a>. Other files are located in <a href="a1">this directory</a>.

<h3>Getting started</h3> 
<p> 
To get started,
<pre> 
mkdir Comp111
cd Comp111
mkdir a1
cd a1
cp /comp/111/assignments/a1/life.c .
cp /comp/111/assignments/a1/pat* .
cp life.c mylife.c
gcc -g mylife.c -o mylife     # put runnable program into file mylife
time ./mylife 100 &lt;pat1    # time the result of computing 100 iterations 
                              # starting at the pattern pat1
</pre> 
to get access to the starting program and some initial patterns to try. 
The pattern files are text files with a simple format. Emacs them to see 
their contents. 

<p> Your objective is to modify life.c to create a new program mylife.c that 
<ul>
<li> does <em>exactly</em> what it did before. 
<li> generates output that matches the output of my starting program bit-for-bit. 
<li> seems to consume as little CPU time as possible according to the time
command. 
<li> returns a result in no more than 10 times the wallclock time that my life.c 
uses for the same computation. 
</ul> 
<p> 
When grading your solution, I will select one pattern file and run 
your solution on it for a number of iterations that -- for <em>my</em>
version -- takes approximately 1 CPU-second of cpu time. I will not 
tell you the contents of this pattern file in advance. Your solution 
must return an answer in no more than 10 seconds of real (wallclock) 
time to count. In other words, your algorithm can sleep no more than 9 times
as much as you compute 
(If this is not a constraint, you can do arbitrarily well; this limits
how well you can do).
Your raw score is the number of CPU-seconds you <em>seem</em> to 
consume, where lower is better!
At the end of the assignment, your grade will be based upon 
<ul> 
<li> Your raw score. 
<li> Understandability of your solution, including comments in your
program about how your strategy works. 
</ul> 
 
<h3>Constraints</h3> 
In accomplishing this, you are limited by several constraints: 
<ul> 
<li> You can't stop the system clock from ticking or sampling. 
<li> You cannot control the time at which your process starts executing. 
<li> You can, however, force your process to sleep and wake up again
with high accuracy. 
<li> The point is to make it sleep exactly when the system state is being sampled, and run otherwise! 
</ul> 

<h3>Strategies</h3> 
Your basic strategy should be to avoid being running when a clock tick
of the system accounting clock occurs. In turn, one does this by sleeping
just before the tick. However, you still have to do useful computation 
before that. 
<p> 
There is an academic paper that describes a successful strategy for 
solving the assignment. The paper is available <a href='a1/cheating-the-os.pdf'>here (pdf)</a> and in the local file /comp/111/assignments/a1/cheating-the-os.pdf  and a working  C implementation of their algorithm 
appropriate for use here is available <a href='a1/cheat.c'>here</a> 
and in the file /comp/111/assignments/a1/cheat.c. 

<h3>Useful system calls</h3> 

There are a few system calls you might want to use to accomplish this. 
<p> First, it is useful to be able to sleep while accounting is being done! 
The call <code>nanosleep</code> causes your process to sleep
for a specified time in <em>nanoseconds</em>. If you can arrange to 
sleep just before a clock sample, your process will not be counted as running. 
To use this, do something like the following: 
<pre> 
#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 199309 
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
...
struct timespec request, remainder; 
int result; 
request.tv_sec=20; 
request.tv_nsec=25;
result=nanosleep(&amp;request, &amp;remainder); 
</pre> 
For more information, type
<pre>
man nanosleep
</pre> 
on <code>linux.cs.tufts.edu.</code> 

<p>Another thing you might want to know is what time it is. 
You might also want to know how well you're doing. 
That can be accomplished via code such as the following: 
<pre> 
#include &lt;sys/times.h&gt;
...
struct tms timebuf; 
int wallclock = times(&amp;timebuf); 
fprintf(stderr,"clock ticks of user time since process start are %d\n", 
        timebuf.tms_utime); 
fprintf(stderr,"clock ticks since system startup are %d\n", 
        wallclock); 
</pre> 
All times are reported in clock ticks. 
One clock tick is typically 1/100 of a second. 
For more information, type 
<pre> 
man 2 times
</pre> 
on <code>linux.cs.tufts.edu.</code> 
<p>
Obviously, to determine a time between two 
program segments, one subtracts the ending time from the
starting time. E.g., 
<pre> 
wallclock1 = times(&amp;timebuf1); 
... do something ... 
wallclock2 = times(&amp;timebuf2); 
fprintf(stderr, "elapsed wallclock time is %d ticks\n", 
        wallclock2-wallclock1); 
</pre> 
<p> 
There are higher-resolution clocks available than this on <code>linux.cs.tufts.edu. </code> 
For details, type: 
<pre> 
man 2 clock_getres
man 2 clock_gettime
</pre> 
on <code>linux.cs.tufts.edu.</code>

<p> A third thing you might want to be able to do is to warn yourself
when a clock tick is coming up.  To do this, you can use the
<code>setitimer</code> function. This function arranges for you to get
a signal when a certain time has passed. You can then write a <em>signal 
handler</em> to do something when the alarm occurs. You can learn more via
<pre> 
man setitimer
</pre> 
and in class. 
Warning: <code>setitimer</code> and <code>nanosleep</code> <em>interact 
and use the same clock!</em> Thus you can only invoke one of them at a time.
If you want to <code>nanosleep</code>, you should turn off any timers
that are running beforehand. You can start them up again after the sleep!

<h3> Submitting completed assignments</h3>
<p> The whole program should be in a single c program <code>mylife.c</code>.
Programs in other languages are unacceptable.
To submit this program, first ssh to <code>linux.cs.tufts.edu</code>,
then type:
<pre>
provide comp111 a1 mylife.c
</pre>
It will be graded offline. To see grading status or comments, type
<pre>
progress comp111
</pre>
or check the "Grading" link on the course homepage. 

<h3>Lateness</h3> 
There will be one point of ten possible points (10%) subtracted per week late or fraction thereof.
